                    The first thing we focused on was what kind of game we wanted to make.
                    Being a new studio, the first game is very important, as it's the starting point for this great world of video game development.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>There were many ideas but we had to choose something that we knew we could do well, or at least that was the idea, and from there Angel Request was born, although it didn't start out called that.</p>

                </div>
                
                <p>At first, everything was ideas, but obviously we couldn't cover everything we could think of, especially since there was only one person developing everything.</p>
                <br>
                <p>But as they say, all journeys begin with a first step, and with that in mind I started building Angel Request.</p>

            <div class="post-content">
                <p>Every story needs a protagonist, so this was the first thing I started programming.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Playing has to be fun, so the protagonist had to be comfortable to handle and respond well to the controls.</p>
                <br>
                <p>This was not an easy task, especially with the first character, I still didn't know very well what I wanted the character to do, doing too much meant the risk of making many mistakes since I still had little knowledge, but doing too little would make the character boring.</p>

                </div>
                <br>
                <p>As soon as I made the first character I was relieved, I thought it hadn't turned out badly at all, but that thought didn't last long. As soon as I started making more characters and little by little I learned more things, I realized how badly I made the first one, rookie mistakes I suppose.</p>

                <p>Every hero needs a villain, so it is not surprising that the next thing in my to do list after the protagonists was the enemies.</p>
                <br>
                <p>The enemies had to go with the theme of the area, and since the first area is a swamp, I had to make swamp enemies.</p>

                <p>The first enemies that came to mind were mushrooms, frogs and insects, there are more options but I had to make at least a few to have something to try, there will be more later.</p>

                <p>I said before that creating the characters was difficult, well I take it back, creating the maps, that is difficult.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Now when I think about all the games I've played and all those well-made levels and worlds come to mind, all I can think is that those people must have been geniuses.</p>
                <br>
                <p>I thought I had a great imagination, until I had to think and design the game levels, and I noticed how I had the creativity of a stone.</p>

                <p>Luckily it was temporary, once I got going things started working out on their own, I had to take references and even then it was difficult, but it wasn't as bad as it seemed at first.</p>

                <p>The game was born as a metroidvania in the first instance, of course since there was nothing done at that time, it was easy to say</p>
                
                <p>Once I started programming, the ideas I was putting down were very little like a Metroidvania, that was the first big change, in which the game became a Roguelike, which was in my opinion a change for the better.</p>
                
                <p>A Roguelike could be "simpler" to climb, and it is a very popular game genre so I continued with this new idea.</p>
